//! `cs` — agent-first command-line interface for IA2.
//!
//! The surface is deliberately small, bash-style: a few META-PRIMITIVES
//! that cover every resource, plus the handful of verbs that carry real
//! domain semantics. See `MEMORY/principles.md` § "CLI is the headline
//! agent interface".
//!
//!   Meta-primitives (any resource, present and future):
//!     cs ls [path]              enumerate (no arg = kinds overview)
//!     cs get <path>             read      (POU paths print raw source)
//!     cs set <path> [--from]    create-or-replace (upsert)
//!     cs rm  <path>             delete    (trailing `/` = folder)
//!     cs api <METHOD> <path>    raw escape hatch — full API parity
//!
//!   Domain verbs (semantics a generic verb shouldn't blur):
//!     check · transpile · symbols · run · stop · runtime … ·
//!     deploy · probe · hmi op/generate · library import ·
//!     project check/info/create/open/close · agent run/enter/leave
//!
//! Contract (every command):
//!   * exit 0 — success
//!   * exit 1 — ran fine but found problems in YOUR content
//!     (diagnostics, failed probe, remote deploy failure)
//!   * exit 2 — the request was wrong (usage, bad path, HTTP 4xx);
//!     the server's error body is printed verbatim on stderr
//!   * exit ≥3 — infrastructure failure (server down, 5xx, I/O)
//!   * `--json` (global) switches to machine output; commands whose
//!     output is inherently JSON (get/api/snapshot/…) always emit JSON
//!   * `--project` / `--server` (global) route every request

IA2 CLI (`cs`) — agent-first PLC engineering tools.

The mental model is bash-sized:
  cs ls                      what kinds of resources exist?
  cs ls pous                 what POUs does the project have?
  cs get devices/plc1        read any resource (JSON, or raw POU source)
  cs set devices/plc1 --from cfg.json    create-or-replace (get → edit → set)
  cs rm  hmi/overview        delete
  cs api POST /api/edges/pi/attach       anything else in docs/api.md

Domain verbs with real semantics keep their own commands: check,
transpile, symbols, run, stop, runtime (pause/step/force/…), deploy,
probe, hmi op/generate, library import, project, agent run.

Exit codes: 0 success · 1 problems in your content (diagnostics /
failed probe / remote deploy failure) · 2 bad request (usage, 4xx —
server's reason printed) · ≥3 infrastructure failure.

`--json` on any command yields machine output. Wrap multi-step work in
`cs agent run --label \"...\" -- <cmd>` so the IDE shows one steady
takeover banner.
